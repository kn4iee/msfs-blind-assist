/// new session (<see cref="StartDisplays"/>: at startup, after a switch to the 757, and when the simulator changes); a
/// flight reload or a dropped connection invalidates the session and restarts them (<see cref="ResetDisplays"/>, from
/// OnSimContextReset); a switch away or the app's exit stops them and disposes the session (<see cref="StopDisplays"/>,

/// plan's reader through its seam, in order (S16). So Ctrl+M (<see cref="MonitorRows"/>, the readers' rows last) and the
/// hotkeys (<see cref="HandleHotkeyAction"/>, the readers' keys first) see every reader before the readers start, and a
/// monitor not started yet sends its key to the AI read.
