/// <summary>
/// BlueBird Simulations 757-200 (package <c>bluebirdsim-aircraft-757-200</c>, release 0.1.0).
///
/// ═══ THE CONTROL MAP ═══
///
/// The panels are not hand-written. <c>tools/b757-gen/generate_b757_map.py</c> reads the
/// aircraft's own cockpit XML and emits <c>bbs757_control_map.json</c> (embedded, loaded by
/// <see cref="Bbs757ControlMap"/>): every regular control's node, panel, spoken label, named
/// positions and the vendor's click code. This class turns each row into one variable keyed by its
/// node and each panel into a panel, in map order. Regenerate the JSON after a BlueBird update
/// rather than patching C#.
///
/// ═══ HOW IT WRITES ═══
///
/// Every control write replays the control's OWN click code through the MobiFlight calculator
/// (<see cref="SimConnectManager.ExecuteCalculatorCodeUnique"/>, the unique prefix of [SIM-17]):
/// the cockpit click updates every var the cockpit updates (the battery click sets both its state
/// var and its <c>_ON</c> legend), so replaying it keeps parity. Before any write the definition
/// asks <see cref="SimConnectManager.CalcWriteCanLand"/> and, when it is false, says
/// "{label} unavailable" and writes nothing (the MD-11's [MD11-16] pattern). It registers
/// <c>MSFSBA_BRIDGE_PROBE</c> so the calc path is verified at all. The writes themselves are in
/// the Interaction partial.
///
/// ═══ BBS NEST ═══
///
/// BlueBird's systems do not run without its companion app; see <see cref="Bbs757Nest"/>. The
/// definition says so once per connection and once per flight load when the process is missing.
///
/// ═══ THE DATA-DEFINITION BUDGET ═══
///
/// Every control is an OnRequest L:var read on demand (one individual data definition each,
/// about 420), the status rows ride the continuous batch or their own on-request read, and the
/// connection's ceiling is about 1000 (docs/architecture.md). The flight-control rows, the 14 MCP
/// lights and the EXEC light ride the batch; the engine rows, the flap angle, the squawk, the
/// altimeters, the decision height, the gear lever, the gross weight and the A/T's armed flag are 19
/// individual definitions (about 500 variables in all). Bbs757DefinitionTests keeps the total under 900.
///
/// ═══ VERIFY IN SIM ═══
///   • A panel pick moves the control and the combo then shows where it really is.
///   • A button press is heard ("… pressed") and the aircraft reacts (MCP mode lights).
///   • With BBS Nest closed, the warning speaks once after connecting; after Nest starts and the
///     flight is reloaded, nothing is said.
///   • Ctrl+H/S/A/V set the MCP heading, speed (knots), altitude and vertical speed, and what is
///     spoken afterwards is the MCP's own value; their mode buttons press as the panel does and say
///     the light once; Shift+H/S/A/V read the same values (Bbs757Mcp).
///   • Flaps, gear, speedbrake, parking brake, the MCP lights and the EXEC light speak their changes,
///     and the trim speaks BlueBird's units while it moves; L, Shift+G, B, F, Shift+F, W and
///     Shift+W read them; Ctrl+B sets the altimeters and the radio minimums,
///     Ctrl+P is the autopilot window, the transponder panel takes a squawk right after its mode knob; the
///     Pedestal's Engines panel shows the stock engine values beside its switches (all in
///     BBS757Definition.Readouts.cs, .Altimeter.cs, .Autopilot.cs).
///   • On the RR the Engines panel lists only the RR fuel control switches; on the PW only the PW ones, and the
///     Overhead has no "Electronic engine control (RR)" panel (plan 12 task 8, from the aircraft title).
