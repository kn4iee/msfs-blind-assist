/// write path (<see cref="IBbs757FoTransport"/>), serialized on one gate, and reports success only
/// when the control reads its target afterwards (FO-9: a refused write is never reported done).
///
/// Most steps are plain map nodes. A few keys are the First Officer's own (<c>FO_*</c>), where one
/// pilot action is several writes or depends on the engine variant:
///   • <see cref="ExtPower"/>: EXT PWR is a momentary button that toggles; pressed only when the ON
///     light differs from the target (and, for ON, only with AVAIL lit), then confirmed on ON.
///   • <see cref="ApuStart"/>: the APU selector to START for <see cref="ApuStartHoldMs"/>, then ON;
///     done once the APU reads starting or running. A flow then WAITS for running in a step of its
///     own (FO-11), so Stop and Pause reach the wait; a checklist tick waits inside its own action
///     (<see cref="StartApuAndWaitAsync"/>), outside the gate.
///   • <see cref="FuelControl1"/>/<see cref="FuelControl2"/>: target 1 RUN, 0 CUTOFF, and
///     <see cref="FuelForStart"/> RUN for a start (RICH on a Rolls-Royce whose EGT reads 0 °C or below,
///     the manual's cold start). The switch pair follows the variant (<see cref="Bbs757FoStateEvaluator.IsPrattAndWhitney"/>);
///     an unknown variant refuses.
///   • <see cref="EngineControls"/>: the engine limiter switches on both variants, and the EEC
///     switches on a Rolls-Royce (a Pratt &amp; Whitney has none). The manual lists the limiters as
///     Rolls-Royce only, but the PW cockpit carries the same switches and BlueBird loads them ON on both
///     (control-verification E3), so setting them ON on a PW only restores what BlueBird loads.
///   • <see cref="ArmAutothrottle"/>: the A/T ARM switch, judged by BlueBird's own armed flag
///     (<c>BBS757_AT_ARMED</c>, R40), never the switch alone; a switch at ARM over a disarmed A/T is
///     cycled OFF then ARM, which is what re-arms it.
///   • <see cref="LightOff1"/>/<see cref="LightOff2"/> and <see cref="Cutout1"/>/<see cref="Cutout2"/>:
///     an engine start's watches, flow only: the light-off (EGT rising within <see cref="LightOffSeconds"/>
///     of the fuel) and the starter cut-out (the selector back in AUTO within <see cref="CutoutSeconds"/>).
///     A watch that times out on a start THIS run engaged and fuelled aborts it (manual p. 204):
///     fuel control CUTOFF, the starter kept at GND motoring (30 s on a PW; at least 30 s and until
///     the EGT is 100 °C or less on a Rolls-Royce), then the selector to AUTO, and the Captain is told.
///   • <see cref="SpeedbrakeArm"/>/<see cref="SpeedbrakeDown"/>: the lever's ARM and DOWN spots,
///     pressed only when the lever reads otherwise, confirmed on the lever; ARM is refused over an
///     extended lever (the flows and checklist lines leave it alone with words first).
///   • <see cref="AltimetersStandard"/>: all three altimeters to standard by value.
///
/// Engine start safety: a start selector goes to GND only on a read N2 below
/// <see cref="Bbs757FoStateEvaluator.StarterReengageN2"/> (the manual re-engages a starter only below
/// 20 % N2, N3 on a Rolls-Royce); a GND a FLOW made is remembered with that run's Stop, and a stopped
/// run puts it back to AUTO while the fuel still reads CUTOFF (<see cref="OnFlowStoppedAsync"/>,
