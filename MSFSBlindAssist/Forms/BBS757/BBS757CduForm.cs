/// screens off the aircraft's Comm Bus and presses keys as held L:vars. Ctrl+Tab switches between
/// the captain's and the first officer's CDU, Ctrl+Shift+L and Ctrl+Shift+R select one by side; the

/// every other aircraft's CDU window), and the scratchpad is read back by <see cref="CduScratchpadAnnouncer"/>
/// once every queued key has had its cycle, which is the state the screen reader cannot know. An entry typed
/// in the scratchpad box is checked as it is read back (<see cref="Bbs757TypedEntryCheck"/>): the scratchpad
/// is read when it holds the entry, and "Scratchpad shows …" is said when the CDU missed a key (plan 08); a
/// key pressed before that goes out at once and leaves it to the ordinary read-back (Alt+C's clear is heard
/// that way too: "Cleared", or "DELETE" when it pressed DEL). A key the window cannot deliver is refused
/// aloud. Ctrl+Tab and the side keys say only which CDU is shown, the CDU already shown included.
/// While the window is hidden two things speak. Keys the pilot sent that were dropped because the link
/// went ("CDU connection lost, keys not sent"). And a message the FMC posts on the captain's scratchpad
/// ("CDU: TAKEOFF DATA UPLINK", R72): the hidden client still scrapes the captain's CDU once a second
/// (<see cref="OnVisibleChanged"/> points it there), <see cref="Bbs757CduMessageWatch"/> tells a message
