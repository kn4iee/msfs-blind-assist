// The 757 EFB settings window's content (BBS757EfbForm.cs builds the window and calls BuildSettingsContent): every setting
// of BlueBird's tablet, read from BlueBird's own files (efb_settings.json and each registration's
// liveries\<registration>-opt.json) and changed in them while no simulator process runs. BlueBird reads the files once,
// when the 757 loads, and writes its own copy back over them while it is loaded, so a change takes effect at the next
// load and none can be made while a simulator runs (docs/b757/evidence/efb-settings.md, section 1). The window holds
// nothing else: the Navigraph sign-in, the nav data update and the SimBrief load are on the tablet window's own pages
// (Bbs757EfbExtras), where the simulator runs.
//
// Top to bottom: the status box (Bbs757SimGuard.StatusText; a read-only TextBox, VAT-13), the Section list (the tablet's
// pages, and ACARS) and the chosen section's rows (Bbs757SettingsRows): a check box for a switch, a label and a choice
// list for the tablet's words, a label and a slider for the random failure frequency, a label and a box for a number or
// text. The EFB colors theme is the one setting offered as no choice: a label and a read-only box with its stored choice
// and the note that non-default color schemes are not supported (B757-21, the owner's rulings of 2026-10-30). Beside the
// box, only while BlueBird's file holds another theme, a Set to Dark blue button writes Dark blue (ui_theme 0) and nothing
// else: the window's one write of ui_theme, and its one button. A registration section starts with the registrations its
// rows apply to. Picking a section rebuilds only the rows' panel; everything else (a save, the simulator closing, the window
// opening) updates the rows in place, so no control is recreated and focus never moves, but from the Set to Dark blue button
// when it goes: to the theme's note.
//
// The settings are writable only while Bbs757SimGuard.SettingsWritable holds, checked when the window opens, on every 1 s
// guard tick while the window shows, and by every write. While it does not, every input stays focusable and readable
// but does not change (a check box does not toggle, a choice list and the slider swallow what would move them, a box is
// read-only, the Set to Dark blue button writes nothing) and an attempt says why, at once (ReadOnlyAttemptText). So does
// a row that waits for another (the announcement categories) or that cannot change for its own state (unreadable,
// automatic). A box is saved by Enter; one left with a change not saved shows the stored value again. A box that can be
// cleared says in its description what empty means (Bbs757EfbSettings.EmptyHint). A save is Bbs757SettingsSave.Run's:
// every key checked first, the writes in order through Bbs757SettingsFile (which logs each save and refusal), the first
// not done everywhere stopping the rest, and the wording; this window reads the files for it, says the outcome and reads
// the files again.
//
// Speech (CORE-7): a check box, a choice list or the slider that saved says nothing, as the reader has said its new
// state; so does the Set to Dark blue button, which goes once its save took, focus moving to the theme's note, which the
// reader then reads as Dark blue; a number or text box says "<label> saved", and "<label> not saved" when left with a
// change not saved; every failure speaks, at once ("Couldn't save <label>: <reason>"); each callout a save switched off
// that showed on is named ("<label> turned off"); the simulator starting or closing while the window shows, or the app no
// longer able to tell whether it runs, is said once (SimChangeText). The pilot's SimBrief ID, Hoppie logon code and
// SayIntentions ACARS key are shown in plain text and never logged: no value, write or row goes into a log line or an
// exception message here.
