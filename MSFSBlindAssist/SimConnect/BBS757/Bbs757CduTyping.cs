/// on 2026-10-26 every pair down to 100 / 50 landed 5 of 5; on 2026-10-27, through the tablet agent's
/// own press as the app types and with the sim busier (the EFB reader's ND pop-out open), 100 / 100
/// landed only 6 of 10, losing a repeated digit ("KATL100.5"), while 100 / 200 landed 15 of 15 and
/// 100 / 300 10 of 10. 100 / 300 keeps a step of margin over the fastest pair that never missed. Never
/// shorten the gap on one quiet measurement: a repeated character needs the key released long enough
