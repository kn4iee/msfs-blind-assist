/// tested. The window (FbwEfbForm) renders headings, buttons, check boxes, choice lists and sliders from the push's "items.N.*" keys
/// (the PMDG client's format) and posts back click_display_element / set_element_value with the element's aidx. A drop-down is a choice
/// list of its entries (plan 21), whose set the bridge taps nothing for until choosing is built (plan 21, Task 7); a text box is a line
/// with what it holds until typing is (plan 22, B757-23).
///
/// Every control the reader offers can be pressed (the owner's ruling of 2026-10-29): a button, tile, switch, check box, slider and tab
/// is clickable whatever the reader's <see cref="Bbs757EfbItem.Clickable"/> says, and nothing here refuses a press. The one exception
/// is the tablet's own: while it shows a question over its page, the page is dimmed and takes no tap, so its controls are text until the
/// question is answered. The question's answers press, and so does the top bar, which stays lit above the dimming. One row is never
/// offered as a control at all, by the owner's ruling of 2026-10-30: the EFB colors theme, whose place holds a note
/// (<see cref="ThemeNoteFor"/>, B757-21).

/// app's extras; "Status bar" with the top bar, then BlueBird's notifications under a heading; "Sections" with the side menu; and Home
/// last. The window speaks only its first alert and remembers one text, so the question is no alert here: the bridge says a
/// question once, through its own alert, when a read first shows it (plan 18, Task 8), and the page keeps its words first. The window's
/// F5 reads the tablet again (get_display_elements), so no element does, and the wheel is no element's either. Names and headings are
