/// whose title holds "BBSNavigraphMap"; <c>Resources/coherent-bbs757-efb-agent.js</c> is installed
/// there (window.__MSFSBA_BBS757EFB) and clicks through the tablet's own mouse handler. The agent
/// clicks wherever it is asked to: neither the client nor the agent refuses a click for the place it
/// lands on (the owner's ruling of 2026-10-29); the press pipeline checks what it taps before it taps.
///
/// Shaped like <see cref="CoherentBbs757TabletClient"/>, without its screen polling: the view is
/// resolved BY TITLE on every (re)connect (its VCockpit number changes on each aircraft load); ONE
/// client per view ([DBG-9]): MainForm owns a single lazily created instance, and the client CLAIMS
/// the view (<see cref="CoherentViewOwnership"/>) from Start to Stop, reconnect gaps included. A
/// still-open socket whose agent went missing gets the agent re-installed on it; any other socket
/// is aborted and disposed before a new one connects ([A380C-2]). An install the page answers
/// NOT_READY (an aircraft reload: the view's scripts or the tablet gauge not there yet) is never
/// taken as installed: it is retried on the same socket, then the view is resolved afresh.
///
/// The loop only keeps the link: it connects, installs, and while the EFB window is shown checks
/// the agent every <see cref="KeepAliveMs"/> ms so the window's status stays true; hidden, it sends
/// nothing. Showing the window pings at once, and that ping or a run's start going unanswered
/// drops the socket straight away (a half-open socket after a reload). <see cref="RunAsync"/>
/// uses the loop's socket and never connects itself, so it cannot race the loop's connection setup
/// ([A380C-3]); it wakes the loop and waits a few seconds for the agent when the link is down.
/// Sequences run one at a time, in the page; a run given up on is canceled there before the next
/// may start, and one still going at Dispose is canceled first.
