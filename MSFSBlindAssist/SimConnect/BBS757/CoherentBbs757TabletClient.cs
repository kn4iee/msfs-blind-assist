/// The BlueBird 757's hidden helper view ("VCockpitNN - BBSTablet") over the MSFS Coherent GT
/// remote debugger (127.0.0.1:19999): both CDU screens, CDU key presses and the Navigraph device
/// code. Shaped like <see cref="CoherentHS787CduClient"/>: the view is resolved BY TITLE on every
/// (re)connect (its VCockpit number changes on each aircraft load), and
/// <c>Resources/coherent-bbs757-tablet-agent.js</c> is installed into it (window.__MSFSBA_BBS757).
///
/// ONE client per view ([DBG-9]): the 757's definition owns a single instance
/// (<c>BBS757Definition.EnsureTabletClient</c>, started on first use, disposed on a switch away) that
/// the CDU window, the EFB window and the background page service (<see cref="Bbs757CduPages"/>)
/// share; the windows subscribe and unsubscribe, never dispose it. The client CLAIMS its view
/// (<see cref="CoherentViewOwnership"/>) from Start to Stop, reconnect gaps included, as
/// <see cref="CoherentA32nxMcduClient"/> does. A still-open socket whose agent went
/// missing gets the agent re-installed on it; any other socket is aborted and disposed before a
/// new one connects ([A380C-2]). An agent is only ever taken as installed while it can hear the
/// Comm Bus: an install the page answers NOT_READY (an aircraft reload, the view's scripts not run
/// yet) is retried on the same socket, and a scrape that shows no listener, or one still not ready
/// after <see cref="ListenerReadyTimeoutMs"/>, installs it again (<see cref="NeedsReinstall"/>).
/// Whenever the link is lost the queued keys are dropped, never sent later to a page nobody has
/// checked (<see cref="KeysDropped"/>). On-demand calls (<see cref="GetNavigraphAsync"/>,
/// <see cref="ScrapeAsync"/>, key presses) only ever use the loop's socket and never connect
/// themselves, so they cannot race the loop's connection setup ([A380C-3]). Every scrape answers
/// the agent's version: one older than <see cref="AgentVersion"/> (an app update over a loaded
/// flight) is installed again on the open socket.
///
/// Screens: the agent keeps each CDU's last Comm Bus frame (they arrive only on change); the loop
/// scrapes the ACTIVE CDU only, every <see cref="PollIntervalMs"/> ms while the CDU window is
/// shown and every <see cref="IdleIntervalMs"/> ms while it is hidden, and raises
/// <see cref="ScreenUpdated"/> when that CDU's frame changed. <see cref="ScrapeAsync"/> reads
/// either CDU once, on demand.
///
/// Keys: one queue for both CDUs, so presses never overlap. Each key carries its hold, the caller's:
/// <see cref="KeyHoldMs"/> by default, since a CLR held about a second clears the whole scratchpad;
/// only <see cref="Bbs757CduPages.WipeScratchpadAsync"/> holds CLR 1300 ms, to do just that. Holds
/// are clamped to <see cref="MinHoldMs"/>-<see cref="MaxHoldMs"/> here and in the agent. Each key
/// carries its gap too: the next key goes out <see cref="KeyGapMs"/> ms after the release unless the
/// caller gives another (only the CDU window's typed entries do, <see cref="Bbs757CduTyping"/>; clamped
/// to <see cref="MinGapMs"/>-<see cref="MaxGapMs"/>).
