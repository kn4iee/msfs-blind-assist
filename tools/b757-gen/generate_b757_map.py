Generate the BlueBird 757-200 control map from the aircraft's cockpit behavior XML.

extract_controls.py (next to this file) expands the vendor's templates and classifies every interactive control;
this script turns those rows into the JSON the app embeds (MSFSBlindAssist/Resources/bbs757_control_map.json):
one entry per control the pilot can operate, with the L:var that holds its state, its positions and the control's
own click code as RPN, to be replayed through the MobiFlight calculator path.

    controls[]  node, section, panel, label, kind, state_var, positions[{value,label}],
                press, release, hold_ms, cw, ccw
                kind: toggle | switch | button | held | select | guard
                state_var: the L:var read back (null when the control keeps no L:var state: a button)
                press / release / cw / ccw: RPN, null when the control has none; a switch with no click code
                (the sim's own 3-state template), or whose click code curation leaves out ("direct_write"), has all
                three null and is written through state_var
                guard, guard_closed, close_sets: on a guarded control only (curation's "guarded"): the node of the
                guard that covers it, the value that guard reads while closed and the value closing it writes to the
                control (null when closing leaves the control alone). A guarded control has no click code at all.
    status[]    key, panel, label, positions[{value,label}], announce: read-only L:vars worth speaking
                (APU state, master warning ...), listed in curation.json

What is derived and what is curated (curation.json):
  derived   kind, state var, positions (the clamps in the turn code, or the vendor's ANIMTIP texts when there is
            one per position), click code, hold time, section (node prefix), a label from the node name (a guard
            is named by what its tip says it covers).
  curated   which vendor banners and nodes are left out, which single nodes under an excluded banner are taken in
            anyway (include_nodes: the banner stays excluded, its panel and section come from a node_panels rule),
            the app's panel names, labels the node name cannot give or the vendor got wrong, position names no
            tooltip carries, the kind of a control whose click code the extractor misreads (kinds: a toggle the
            extractor took for a button, a radio-style select that is only ever pressed), the guarded controls
            (guarded: a switch whose click only runs while a guard is open), the switches whose click code is left
            out (direct_write: a lever whose code cannot take a pick where it aims), the nodes kept although no
            cockpit model has them (keep_without_node), the status rows, and the ORDER the pilot tabs through: the
            panels of a section (panel_order) and the controls of a panel (control_order). A curated label, position
            list, kind, guarded, direct_write or keep_without_node entry, exclusion or inclusion for a node the
            package does not have is an error (a stale entry never hides); so is a kind or an inclusion that does
            nothing, and so is an order that names a panel or a node that is not there. A kind only re-reads a control
            the rules keep: for one they drop it changes nothing and is only reported.
            The vendor's tooltip titles and toggle tips are never labels: the vendor copied them between controls.
  cockpit   BlueBird ships one interior model per engine variant, and a control can be clicked only where a node of its
            name is in the model. The run reads the node names of BBS_752_PW_INTERIOR.gltf and BBS_752_RR_INTERIOR.gltf
            from the package (it stops when either is missing, found twice or not a glTF with nodes), and the map holds
            only controls the cockpit has. A control whose node is in neither model is left out: the last of the drop
            rules, counted as "no cockpit node" and named in the run's report with the label it would have had and its
            vendor banner (the rules before it keep their own counts). A control that one model alone has says which,
            with " (PW)" or " (RR)" at the end of its label unless the label already ends so ("L Fuel Control (PW)"
            stays), and the run names each. A label that says (PW) or (RR) is true of exactly that model's cockpit: on a
            control the other model has too, or only the other has, it stops the run. Curation's keep_without_node keeps
            a control BlueBird's own list proves real although neither model has a node for it; it is empty unless that
            list proves one, and the run names each. An entry for a node the package does not have, that a model has,
            that curation also excludes or that the rules leave out for another reason is an error. No curation entry
            brings back a control no cockpit has, whatever the other rules make of it (their reason comes before the
            cockpit's): a guarded or an include_nodes entry for one stops the run, a kind, label or positions entry for
            one changes nothing and is only reported, and an order or a direct_write entry that names it, or an order
            that names a panel the drop emptied, is a stale one. Only keep_without_node keeps such a control. A panel
            with no control left is not in the map (panels exist only through their controls).
  order     the map's order IS the order the app's panels, and their controls, come in. Sections keep SECTIONS'
            order. A panel in panel_order comes first, in the listed order; the panels not listed follow
            alphabetically, and the run names them (a panel BlueBird adds later turns up there). A node in
            control_order comes first in its panel, in the listed order; the rest follow in cockpit order. Labels are
            made in cockpit order before either is applied, so an order never renames or renumbers a control.
  a toggle, guard or select that writes a value other than 0 or 1 to its state var stops the run until its
            positions are named in curation (A/T ARM writes 10).
  guarded   a switch whose vendor click only runs while its guard is open (the emergency lights switch, the stab trim
            cutouts). The extractor records that gate as an '[if <test>] ' note in front of the click code, which is
            not RPN, so none of the click is kept: press, release, cw and ccw are empty, and the control carries the
            state var and the positions curation gives it, the guard's node, the value the guard reads while closed and
            the value closing it writes to the control. The app opens the guard, writes the position and closes it. The
            guard keeps its own row. Curation may take in a control the rules leave out (the emergency lights switch's
            animation reads an O: var) or re-read one they keep (the stab trims), and the run names each; it never
            overrides curation's own exclusions. The entry is checked against the vendor's code: the click writes the
            state var, its gate reads the guard's var, and the guard's own click writes close_sets to the control. Any
            other control whose click code carries a gate note stops the run.
  direct_write  a switch whose vendor click code cannot take a pick where it aims and writes nothing but its own L:var
            (and O:vars; the chronometer ET lever: its clockwise code steps the value down and its anticlockwise code
            steps it up but jumps HOLD straight to RESET, so a step can land on no position at all; the flight deck door
            switch: its clockwise and anticlockwise codes write 2 and 0 whatever it reads, so a step to Auto from an end
            lands on the other end). Curation lists the node and the map leaves all of its click code out: press,
            release, cw and ccw are empty, and the app writes the state var to the picked position, as it does for any
            switch with no click code. The control is otherwise built by the rules (state var, kind, label, panel and
            positions unchanged), and its positions are still checked against what the vendor's code writes. The entry
            is checked against that code, so that a change of BlueBird's stops the run instead of reaching the app: the
            map must keep the node, a switch with a state var and positions to pick from, and not also under kinds or
            guarded; its click code must exist (else the entry does nothing), carry no gate note (a gated click belongs
            under guarded, which opens the guard first) and write nothing but the state var (another L:var, a K: or an
            H: event would no longer run). A write to an O:var is let through: O:vars belong to the component, and the
            sim's calculator cannot set one, so the app's replay never performed it and leaving it out loses nothing it
            could do (the door switch's click stamps (>O:UpdateTime) for the component's own 1 Hz spring-back, which
            still runs after a direct write). The run names each, and what it left out.

press / release / cw / ccw are the cockpit's own click code, VERBATIM: the app replays exactly what a click in the
cockpit runs, so a slip the cockpit has stays a slip in the replay (a guarded or direct_write control has none). Code
that looks like a slip (a set without its 'L:', a closing brace nothing opened) is only reported, as suspected_slips;
nothing is changed.

Dropped, and counted in the printed report: circuit breakers, CDU keys, levers, infinite knobs, finite knobs with
more than 12 positions, anything in an excluded banner or node (but an include_nodes node under an excluded banner
is kept), controls with no click code or whose state is not an L:var, controls the cockpit does not have (no node in
either interior model: "no cockpit node", named in the report), and the second row of a node the interior files
repeat (the PW and RR variants).

Usage:  python -I tools/b757-gen/generate_b757_map.py [<package folder>] [--out <json>] [--curation <json>]
        With no folder the package is looked for in Community and Community2024 under
        %LOCALAPPDATA%\\Packages\\Microsoft.Limitless_8wekyb3d8bbwe\\LocalCache\\Packages. Reads the package only (its
        interior behavior files and the node names of its two interior models, BBS_752_PW_INTERIOR.gltf and
        BBS_752_RR_INTERIOR.gltf).

    state var to write and positions to pick a value from, and not also under kinds, which keeps the click code verbatim.
    The click code: leaving it out must lose nothing, so a change of BlueBird's stops the run instead of reaching the app.
    There is code to leave out (else the entry does nothing), none of it gated on a guard (that control belongs under
    'guarded', which opens the guard first), and it writes nothing but the state var: another L:var, or a K: or H: event it
    fires, would no longer run. A write to an O:var is let through (ruling R12, the flight deck door switch: its click
    stamps (>O:UpdateTime) beside the state var). An O:var belongs to the component, and the sim's calculator cannot set
    one (spec 3.7 #6: the fire handle relock runs on O:vars it cannot set), so the app's replay of that click never
    performed the write either, and leaving it out loses nothing the app could do. Reads are no loss at all."""
